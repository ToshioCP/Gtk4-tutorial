Once upon a time, there was an old man who was called Taketori-no-Okina. It is a japanese word that means a man whose work is making bamboo baskets.
One day, he went into a mountain and found a shining bamboo. "What a mysterious bamboo it is!," he said. He cut it, then there was a small cute baby girl in it. The girl was shining faintly. He thought this baby girl is a gift from Heaven and took her home.
His wife was surprized at his story. They were very happy because they had no children.
